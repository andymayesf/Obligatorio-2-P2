This webapp i done was a project i created for the Programming 2 course in University.

It is a Restaurant's webapp where you can create an account and order food at the restaurant or by delivery.
It has different functions where registered clients can see filtered orders by date at the restaurant, see the most expensive orders and list the orders that included a certain dish in the past.

The waiters that work in the restaurant can see their delivered orders between dates.

The delivery man/women can see all their delivered orders.
